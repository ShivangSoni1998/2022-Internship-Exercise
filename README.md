# Work / Project Examples

I have participated in three projects. Details of the projects are as follows. 

1) Stock Acuity - Analysis of Stock Market Prices (Oct 2021 - Dec 2021)
• Technologies used: Hadoop, Hive, Python, Jupyter Notebook, Tableau Public
• An application that delivers in-depth study and insights about the historical prices and volume
variations of New York Stock Exchange-listed firms (NASDAQ) by virtual representation
• Created two nodes Hadoop clusters and made the database distributed across the nodes which led
the data centrally available for faster access and robustness of the data
• Executed HQL queries on the database for finding insights and showcased it in the form of graphs
on Tableau Public

2) Linking (May 2021 - Aug 2021)
• Technologies used: React Native Expo, Node Js, Express Js, MongoDB, JIRA, Github
• “Linking” is a cross-platform mobile application with an intuitive UI that helps users find nearby places based on their choices and make a connection to other people who share the same interest
• Organized the team as Product Owner and performed the process of management, requirements gathering, analysis of the requirements
• Developed the product within the deadline which led to the creation of robust and useful applications for the users

Application Features:
- Help users find the places to visit of their choice 
- Connect with the people who share the same interest
- Chat with the connected user
- Block the suspicious users

This application improves networking by helping users connect to other likeminded people.

3) Rescue and Rehabilitation (Jan 2020 - March 2020)
• Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, PHP, MySQL
• "War Child" is a UK based NGO which provides assistance to children in areas experiencing conflict and the aftermath of conflict. The workers of this NGO provide assistance to those children by bringing them back from the areas where they are kidnapped or brainwashed by some terrorist groups, cure them and deliver them to their respective parents. During this work, it is very arduous job for the workers to maintain the records of the children at each step of their process of bringing, curing and delivering them
• So Rescue and Rehabilitation is a simple website having intuitive user interface which eases the tasks of workers by providing them the easy way of storing the records of children and maintaining their status at each step from rehabilitating to delivering the children


# Inspiration

I believe that world is going to be fully digital in upcoming years. Being digital means conveniency to the customer and one of the ways of achieving conveniency for the customer is by creating amazing websites that have an intuitive design. Such websites could make customer's tasks easier by solving their problem on providing conveniency through the websites. 

There are few websites from which I get really inspired are https://www.netflix.com/ca/, https://www.amazon.ca/, etc. These websites are so amazing and interactive. The main thing which I like about these websites is their user interface. The user interface is so fascinating that no one could resist themselves to interact with it. The more interactive webiste is the more customer is going to visit. The customers could not resist themselves without visiting these websites and surfing them for a while. 

I truly wanna be part of the development of such websites which could be the reason for customer rentention in any company.


# Focus

I believe that time is money. If I were given time to buildlearn during the internship, I would surely invest my time in learning the technologies to more extent that company is using for the development. This way I would get upskilled and become more useful to the company. Other than that, I would connect with the peers and improve my networking during the internship. This way I would get to know the work ethics, environment, culture of the company. Moreover I believe that knowledge increases by sharing and connecting with people. I could increase my knowledge that is relevant to the postion, company and become more useful to the company.
